# Heart-Disease-Prediction-with-UCI-heart-disease-dataset
In this project UCI heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning data repository was used. Firstly preprocessing of the data was done followed by normalization of the data and feature selection. For SVM classifier model, linear, polynomial and radial basis function (rbf) kernels were used, and parameter tuning was done with ‘gamma’ and ‘C-value’.

To visualize data models, Plotly Dash was used. It is a rather simple library that allows building and deploying interactive web applications purely in Python. The applications are used through the browser and can operate via local host as well as be deployed and shared with URLs. In app layout, dash_core_components and dash_html_components were used. Some dash_html_components were used for adding titles, text and style. And a tool that predicts the severity of cardiovascular diseases was made.
