# Heart-Disease-Prediction-with-UCI-heart-disease-dataset
In this project UCI heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning data repository was used. Firstly preprocessing of the data was done followed by normalization of the data and feature selection. For SVM classifier model, linear, polynomial and radial basis function (rbf) kernels were used, and parameter tuning was done with ‘gamma’ and ‘C-value’.
